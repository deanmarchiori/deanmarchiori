abstract: The aim of this guide is to help marketing, business and analytics experts understand how to get the biggest impact from their marketing budget.Our focus is on marketing attribution. That is, the way in which we can measure and assign credit to individual marketing channels, even when we are simultaneously advertising via many channels. Only by understanding this can we generate meaningful estimates on the return we get from each channel and therefore guide future spending decisions.
